# Validation Strategy

## design.json Structure

```json
{
  "schema": "design-spec.v1",
  "model": "bracket",
  "units": "mm",
  "intent": "What this part does",
  "features": [
    {
      "id": "feature_id",
      "intent": "What this feature is for",
      "checks": ["check_id_1", "check_id_2"]
    }
  ],
  "checks": [
    { "id": "check_id_1", "type": "bbox_size", ... }
  ]
}
```

Every feature must reference at least one existing check ID. The validator
enforces feature-to-check coverage automatically.

## Choosing Check Types

### Overall envelope
- `bbox_size` — bounding box dimensions with tolerance
- `volume_range` — volume within min/max range
- `watertight` — manifold mesh (no boundary edges)

### Artifact presence
- `artifact_exists` — file exists at the given path (relative to model dir)

### Holes and circular features
- `outer_diameter_at_z` — section plane intersection, outer diameter estimate
- `inner_diameter_at_z` — section plane intersection, inner diameter estimate
- These use STL triangle-plane intersection, best for axisymmetric geometry

### Tapers, chamfers, and sockets
- `diameter_decreases_along_z` — monotonic diameter change across Z samples
- Combine with `outer_diameter_at_z` at key Z values for both-end verification

### Design intent metadata
- `metadata_equals` — check a path in metadata.json matches expected value
- Use as supplementary evidence, never as the sole check for a feature

### Mesh quality
- `min_triangles` — minimum triangle count (catches degenerate exports)

## Section Checks in Detail

Section checks slice the STL at a given Z height and estimate radial envelope
around a center point. They work best for axisymmetric features (cylinders,
ducts, sockets, tapers).

```json
{
  "id": "socket_od_at_z10",
  "type": "outer_diameter_at_z",
  "z": 10.0,
  "expected": 79.4,
  "tolerance": 0.3,
  "center": [0.0, 0.0]
}
```

For off-axis holes (e.g., bolt holes at corners), section checks centered at
(0,0) will not work. Use `metadata_equals` to record the design intent and add
a comment that a geometry check for that position is not yet available.

## Tolerance Selection

- 0.1-0.2 mm: tight fit, bearing surfaces, critical mating dimensions
- 0.3-0.5 mm: general mechanical, slip fits, clearance holes
- 0.5-1.0 mm: non-critical, cosmetic, large structural parts
- STL mesh resolution affects measurement precision. Typical export tolerance
  is around 0.01 mm but section checks use percentile estimation which adds
  ~0.1 mm uncertainty. Do not set tolerances below 0.1 mm for section checks.

## Feature Coverage Strategy

1. List every user-visible or functional feature in `features`
2. For each feature, pick the most direct check type
3. If no existing check type can verify it, use `metadata_equals` as a
   placeholder and note the limitation
4. Never leave a feature without at least one check reference

## Check Design Anti-Patterns

- Checking only bbox + watertight: these pass even when features are missing
- Using metadata_equals as the sole check for a geometry feature
- Setting tolerance to 0: STL mesh quantization makes exact matches unreliable
- Not checking both ends of a taper or socket
